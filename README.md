1563 - Regulated Industries Security and Compliance in the AI Era

Abstract: Regulated Industries, like Financial Services, Health, Telco and Government have requirements for Gen AI to support productivity gains and higher revenue. At the same time, Regulated Industries have the highest requirements for security and compliance, so such AI opportunities can also raise trust, security and regulatory compliance risks in multiple levels: from the solution infrastructure all the way to data security and privacy, to model bias, explainability and AI robustness. In this lab you will learn how to quickly create an enterprise Level GenAI solution using IBM Cloud Regulated Industries with Watsonx.ai and Watsonx Governance to provide a secure and trusted environment to deploy and govern generative AI applications through their lifecycle.

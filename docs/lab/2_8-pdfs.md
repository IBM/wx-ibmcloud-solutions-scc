**Benefits of Using Own Documents:**
* **Accuracy:** The responses are more accurate because they are based on the precise information contained in your documents.
* **Context-Specific:** The answers are tailored to the specific context and terminology of your documents, making them more relevant and useful.
* **Efficiency:** It reduces the need for extensive background knowledge input during each query, as the system can dynamically pull in relevant information from the documents.
* **Personalization:** It allows for a personalized experience, as the responses are generated using your own data, reflecting your unique context and requirements.

In summary, uploading your own documents for allows the language model to access and use specific information from those documents, leading to more precise and contextually appropriate responses.

# Gen AI Application Repository 
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is like having a smart assistant that not only uses its own knowledge but also looks through files to find the best information to help answer user questions. 

IBM Watson Discovery digests, indexes, and stores the bank's content from its own FAQ/blog knowledge base. Upon receiving inquiries from the end user, the watsonx assistant generated chatbot employs an AI-powered natural language search query, known as semantic search, to extract relevant content from the bank's knowledge base. Finally, a foundation model in watsonx.ai is inferred using prompts to provide a summary response based on the obtained text.

The linked repository offers several customization options for adapting the RAG application.
**Update UI:** this can be modified to suit a different use case, providing a tailored experience. 

**Upload new documents:** The documents can be replaced to reflect specific information to new use case. 

**Change entire application:** The application can be overhauled to meet unique requirements. However, it is important to note that significant changes to the application may necessitate adjustments to the infrastructure to ensure compatibility and functionality.

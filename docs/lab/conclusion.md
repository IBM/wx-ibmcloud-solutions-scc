# Conclusion and Next Steps

The objective of this lab was to provide participants with hands-on experience in navigating a cloud environment where a Deployable Architecture (DA) for a generative AI (Gen AI) solution has been implemented, and to perform actions to enhance the Gen AI solution's compliance. Participants achieved the following goals:

1. **Understanding the RAG DA Deployed Resources:** In the first half of the lab, participants examined the various cloud resources deployed by the DA. They identified and understood the components and services that make up the deployed architecture, gaining insights into how these resources integrate to form a secure and compliant Gen AI solution.

2. **Implementing and Observing Changes:** In the second half of the lab, participants made modifications to a resource within the environment. They observed how the Security and Compliance Center (SCC) detects these changes and re-evaluates the compliance of the environment. This exercise demonstrated the dynamic nature of SCC in enforcing security and compliance policies.

Participants gained a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in deploying enterprise-level AI applications, the critical importance of security and compliance, and how automated tools like DAs and SCC facilitate these processes.

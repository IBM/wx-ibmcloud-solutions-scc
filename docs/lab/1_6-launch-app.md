# Launch Sample Application

We have a Generative AI application running on IBM Cloud that was developed using watsonx capabilities. It offers a chatbot that can answer inquiries regarding bank loans for potential customers. The chatbot employs a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern, in which the bank's loan documentation and policies serve as the knowledge base to augment the Gen AI. 

Let's see the RAG Pattern Gen AI application in action: Assume you're a prospective consumer searching for a loan. You visit a bank's website and begin asking queries to the virtual agent. Using the bank's own data and the generative AI foundation model, the virtual agent generates solutions based on the inquiry, whether it's a general topic or trying to identify a specific loan product.

1. Switch to the **Applications (A)** tab and select **Open URL (B)** to launch the application.

3. Ask the virtual assistant questions. Here are some example questions to get you started.
* I need help in getting a loan
* What types of loans do you offer?
* What is conventional fixed rate loan?
* Is fixed rate better than variable rate?
* How much does a loan cost?
* Why do I need escrow?
* I want to buy a very expensive property, which loan do you suggest?

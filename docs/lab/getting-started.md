# Getting started

**Objective of this Lab** <br>
 <br>
 The objective of this lab is to provide participants with hands-on experience in exploring a cloud environment where a Deployable Architecture (DA) for a Gen AI solution has been deployed and then perform actions to improve the Gen AI solution compliance . The lab is structured to achieve the following goals:

1.	**Understand the RAG DA Deployed Resources:** In the first half of the lab, participants will examine the various cloud resources that have been deployed by the DA. This will include identifying and understanding the components and services that make up the deployed architecture, providing insight into how these resources integrate to form a secure and compliant generative AI (Gen AI) solution.

2.	**Implement and Observe Changes:** In the second half of the lab, participants will make modifications to a resource within the environment. They will then observe how the Security and Compliance Center (SCC) detects these changes and re-evaluates the compliance of the environment. This exercise will demonstrate the dynamic nature of SCC in enforcing security and compliance policies. 

By the end of the lab, participants will have a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in deploying enterprise-level AI applications, the importance of security and compliance, and how automated tools like DAs and SCC facilitate these processes.

# Deployment Process

**Configuration and Customization:**
The DA is designed to be highly customizable, allowing users to add or remove components based on their specific needs and requirements. This ensures flexibility and adaptability to various use cases and environments.

**Rapid Deployment:**
By leveraging automation, the DA enables the rapid deployment of the entire solution stack. This significantly reduces the time and effort required to set up the infrastructure, allowing for deployment within hours.

## High-Level Workflow

1. **Review Deployed DA Stack**:  
Participants begin by reviewing the deployed Digital Automation (DA) stack within the lab environment.

2. **Review Deployed Resources**:  
participants will review the key resources within the account, such as Toolchains, Code Engine, and Security and Compliance Center (SCC), to understand the infrastructure and services in place.

3. **Identify and Remediate a Resource using SCC**:  
In this step, participants will identify a failed or non-compliant resource using SCC. They will review a completed SCC scan and follow remediation steps to bring the resource into compliance.

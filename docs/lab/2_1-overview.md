# Observe and Remediate SCC Controls

Welcome to the second half of the lab. In this section, you will run a scan using the Security and Compliance Center (SCC) on the lab environment. The SCC enforces security and compliance policies based on the IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services and AI ICT Guardrails profiles.

You will begin by running the scan to generate a report that identifies which resource need attention. Once you've made the necessary changes to that resource, you will rerun the SCC scan to observe and confirm the improvements.

**Objective:**
To understand how the SCC identifies compliance issues in a cloud environment, and to learn how to resolve these issues to maintain a secure and compliant environment.

**Outcome:**
By the end of this section, you will be able to run SCC scans, fix non-compliant resources, and confirm that these changes are recognized in the updated SCC report, demonstrating improved compliance.

# Observe and Remediate SCC Controls

Welcome to the second half of the lab. In this section, you will review a scan completed by the Security and Compliance Center (SCC) on the lab environment. SCC enforces security and compliance policies using the IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services and AI ICT Guardrails profiles. 

You will start by identifying controls that are failing. You will then fix one of these errors in the cloud environment. After implementing the fix, you will rerun the SCC scan to verify that the control is no longer failing and is marked as green.

**Objective:**
To understand how the SCC detects and responds to compliance issues in a cloud environment, and to learn how to correct these issues to ensure a secure and compliant setup.

**Outcome:**
By the end of this section, you will be able to identify failing security controls, implement fixes in the cloud environment, and verify that these changes are recognized by SCC, demonstrating an improved compliance posture.
